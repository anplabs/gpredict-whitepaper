# Governance

gPredict is designed to evolve into a community‑driven protocol where users, creators, validators, and stakeholders collectively shape the future of the prediction ecosystem. Governance will be introduced progressively, beginning with a guided, semi‑centralized model during the MVP phase and transitioning into a decentralized structure as participation grows.

This section outlines gPredict’s governance philosophy, decision‑making processes, roles, and long‑term decentralization path.


## **1. Governance Philosophy**

gPredict governance is built around four core principles:

- **Transparency** — every rule, fee, and decision must be openly accessible
- **Fairness** — no group should hold disproportionate power
- **Meritocracy** — active, accurate contributors should hold influence
- **Progressive Decentralization** — governance expands as the ecosystem matures

The end goal is a governance system that distributes power based on participation, reputation, and token ownership (when introduced), rather than early insider control.


## **2. Governance Phases**

### **Phase 0 — MVP Governance (Centralized with Transparency)**

During the initial launch:

- ANP Labs maintains core control
- All fees and system parameters are publicly documented
- Community feedback directly informs updates
- No governance token yet (GPRED will be introduced later)

This ensures stability while the protocol grows its user base.


### **Phase 1 — Community‑Guided Governance**

As usage increases:

- Feedback channels influence parameter adjustments
- Highly‑rated creators and validators receive advisory privileges
- Community polls may be used for non‑critical decisions
- Governance proposals become part of the roadmap

The system begins shifting from “builder‑led” to “community‑steered.”


### **Phase 2 — Token Governance (GPRED Launch)**

When the GPRED token is introduced:

- Governance rights are tied to GPRED + Reputation
- Token holders may vote on:
  - fee structures
  - creator/validator reward percentages
  - inclusion of new market types
  - oracle providers
  - treasury usage
  - security upgrades
  - chain expansion initiatives

Decisions are executed on‑chain for transparency and immutability.


### **Phase 3 — Full Decentralization**

In the long term:

- Governance power transitions entirely to token holders + reputational stakeholders
- DAO committees may be formed to handle:
  - auditing
  - oracle oversight
  - proposal review
  - creator and validator on‑ramping
- Treasury management becomes fully on‑chain

ANP Labs retains no privileged control, acting only as a contributor.


## **3. Governance Participants**

### **3.1 GPRED Token Holders**

Once the token launches, holders can:

- Vote on proposals
- Delegate voting power
- Stake to participate in advanced decisions
- Submit improvement proposals (GIPs: gPredict Improvement Proposals)

Holders of more tokens have more influence, but reputation prevents whales from dominating.


### **3.2 Reputation Holders (Non‑Transferable)**

Reputation is earned through:

- Accurate predictions
- Creating high‑quality markets
- Reliable validation work
- Participating in governance

Reputation may:

- Boost voting power
- Unlock governance roles
- Give access to creator/validator councils

Reputation cannot be bought, preserving fairness.


### **3.3 Validators**

Validators have specialized authority:

- Vote on oracle result accuracy
- Participate in settlement governance
- Propose improvements to oracle infrastructure
- Earn validator rewards for honest participation

Validators must remain neutral and strictly follow settlement rules.


### **3.4 Creators**

Creators may influence:

- Category expansion
- Market quality guidelines
- Community-driven forecasting themes
- Creator reward structures

Top creators may be granted governance boosts via reputation.


## **4. Governance Proposal Flow**

1. **Draft Stage**
   - Anyone can submit an idea to the forum/Discord
2. **Review Stage**
   - Reviewed by a small governance committee (early phase)
3. **Formal Proposal (GIP)**
   - Published publicly with rationale and impact analysis
4. **Voting Phase**
   - GPRED + Reputation determine voting weight
   - Voting remains open for a set duration
5. **Execution**
   - On‑chain smart contract updates
   - Off‑chain operational changes implemented

All governance actions are logged for transparency.


## **5. Treasury Governance**

Once formed, the Treasury DAO manages:

- Protocol revenue allocation
- Grants to creators and community builders
- Validator program incentives
- Marketing and ecosystem expansion partnerships
- Emergency funds and audits

Treasury decisions follow the same proposal + voting process.


## **6. Guardrails & Security**

To protect the protocol, governance includes built‑in safeguards:

- **Time‑lock delays** for executing major changes
- **Quorum requirements** to prevent low‑participation decisions
- **Emergency veto** (Phases 0–1 only) to block malicious proposals
- **Slashing for validators** acting against protocol interests
- **Multi‑sig oversight** during early decentralization

These guardrails ensure responsible governance evolution.


# Summary

gPredict’s governance model follows a progressive decentralization roadmap: beginning with transparent builder control, transitioning to community‑guided decision‑making, and ultimately evolving into a fully decentralized, token‑governed protocol. Through GPRED, reputation, and validator participation, governance becomes an inclusive system where those who contribute the most shape the future of gPredict.
