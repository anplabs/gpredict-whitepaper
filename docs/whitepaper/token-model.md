# Token Model

gPredict launches without a native token to ensure simplicity, reduce early friction, and avoid unnecessary complexity during the MVP phase. However, the protocol is intentionally designed with a clear path toward introducing a future utility and governance token — **GPRED** — once the ecosystem demonstrates sufficient traction, stability, and community engagement.

This section outlines the future token model, its purpose, and how it integrates into the overall economy.


## **1. Why No Token at MVP?**

Launching gPredict without a token provides several advantages:

- Removes onboarding barriers for new users
- Prevents early speculation that may distort markets
- Eliminates regulatory complexity during the initial rollout
- Allows the protocol to prove real usage before token economics are introduced
- Ensures SOMI remains the primary currency for prediction activity

A token should be introduced only when it serves a functional need — not as a marketing tool.


## **2. The GPRED Token (Planned Phase 2+)**

The GPRED token, once launched, is designed to serve three primary functions:

### **2.1 Utility**

GPRED unlocks enhanced features for active participants:

- Reduced protocol fees
- Boosts for creators (higher visibility, featured spots)
- Validator performance bonuses
- Access to advanced analytics or creator tools

### **2.2 Governance**

GPRED holders will participate in protocol decisions such as:

- Fee structure updates
- Approval of new market types
- Oracle provider additions
- Validator program rules
- Treasury usage

Governance ensures that the protocol’s evolution reflects community values.

### **2.3 Staking & Security**

For validators:

- GPRED can be staked to participate in validation
- Slashing occurs if validators intentionally submit incorrect results
- Staking strengthens oracle security and reduces the risk of manipulation

For creators:

- Optional staking boosts visibility
- Creates a reputation-backed prediction ecosystem


## **3. Token Distribution Model (Draft for Phase 2+)**

A sustainable and community-driven distribution model may include:

- **40% — Community Rewards**

  - Participants, creators, validators
  - Seasonal competitions and liquidity incentives

- **20% — Treasury & Sustainability**

  - Future grants
  - Ecosystem partnerships
  - Oracle network maintenance

- **20% — Team & Founders**

  - Multi-year vesting
  - Performance-based unlocks

- **10% — Investors / Strategic Partners**

  - Locked for long-term alignment

- **10% — Reserve / Emergency Allocations**
  - Used only with governance approval

Final distribution will be determined through community discussion prior to token launch.


## **4. Token Mechanics**

### **4.1 Staking**

Participants can stake GPRED to:

- Support validators
- Earn protocol rewards
- Boost roles in governance

Staking strengthens protocol security and incentivizes long-term engagement.

### **4.2 Fee Reductions & Boosts**

Holding or staking GPRED may grant:

- Lower protocol fees
- Higher creator rewards
- Validator multipliers
- Discounted dispute resolution fees

### **4.3 Reputation Integration**

Reputation (non-transferable) + GPRED (transferable) combine to:

- Boost creator market visibility
- Improve validator trust ratings
- Prioritize community-approved contributions

This hybrid system prevents whales from dominating governance solely through token holdings.


## **5. Cross-Chain Token Strategy (Future)**

As gPredict expands across chains:

- GPRED may be natively deployed on multiple EVM networks
- Cross-chain bridges will be used cautiously to avoid fragmentation
- Validator staking and governance remain unified
- Liquidity may be incentivized on the primary host chain (e.g., Somnia)

Cross-chain design ensures GPRED remains cohesive regardless of ecosystem expansion.


## **6. Launch Conditions**

GPRED will only launch when:

- Prediction volume reaches stable organic growth
- Validator network is actively decentralized
- Market creators consistently contribute
- Oracle infrastructure is proven reliable
- Community interest in governance is strong

The goal is a responsible, utility-first token launch.


# Summary

The GPRED token is not required for gPredict’s MVP but plays a key role in the long-term vision: powering governance, strengthening validator security, rewarding creators and participants, and supporting the multi-chain evolution of the protocol. The token model is intentionally flexible, enabling future expansion without compromising the simplicity and user-first design of the protocol today.
