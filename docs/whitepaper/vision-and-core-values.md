# Vision and Core Values

gPredict envisions a world where forecasting becomes an accessible public tool—empowering communities, builders, and everyday users to collectively anticipate future events. By removing the barriers that have historically made prediction markets complex or exclusionary, gPredict aims to democratize the act of forecasting and transform it into a shared, intuitive experience.

Our mission is to create the simplest, most transparent, and most community-centric prediction market ecosystem in Web3. Built first on Somnia and designed for scalability across multiple chains, gPredict establishes a foundation that blends usability, fairness, and collective intelligence.

To guide the project’s long-term evolution, gPredict is anchored by six core values:

## **1. Simplicity**

Prediction markets should not require expert knowledge. gPredict prioritizes:

- clean UX flows
- minimal friction for creating or joining predictions
- logical market structures people instantly understand

Simplicity ensures accessibility across all user types—from crypto-natives to newcomers.

## **2. Transparency**

Trust emerges from clarity. gPredict integrates:

- open-source settlement logic
- clear audit trails
- visible odds and pool balances
- oracle data made verifiable

Users must always understand how outcomes are decided and how rewards are calculated.

## **3. Community-Driven Growth**

gPredict is shaped by its community:

- Market creators drive the ecosystem
- Voters influence governance decisions
- Validators participate in settlement reliability
- Social groups can form prediction leagues and competitions

The system evolves based on what the community values and uses most.

## **4. Fairness & Neutrality**

gPredict does not take sides and does not influence outcomes.  
The platform’s responsibility is to:

- maintain fair reward distribution
- prevent manipulation
- ensure oracle objectivity
- protect market integrity

Every participant competes within the same transparent rules.

## **5. Multi-Chain Future**

While Somnia is the first home of gPredict, the architecture is designed to expand.  
The multi-chain roadmap will offer:

- cross-chain liquidity
- unified identity
- broader access to global communities
- ability to host predictions tied to any ecosystem

gPredict aims to become a universal layer for forecasting across Web3.

## **6. Scalability & Modularity**

The platform is built with modular components that can grow over time:

- Oracle module
- Market engine module
- Reputation and governance systems
- Incentive modules
- Chain adapters for expansion

This ensures a future-proof design capable of supporting thousands of concurrent markets and millions of users.


gPredict's vision and core values serve as the philosophical and functional blueprint for how the platform is built, governed, and expanded. Together, they define a prediction ecosystem rooted in accessibility, transparency, and collective intelligence—empowering users to shape the future, one forecast at a time.
