# Roadmap

The gPredict roadmap follows a clear, staged progression from a simple, Somnia-native MVP into a fully decentralized, community-owned, multi-chain prediction ecosystem. Each phase builds on proven traction, prioritizing stability, security, and user experience.

This roadmap outlines the planned evolution of gPredict across four major phases.


## **Phase 0 — Foundation & MVP Preparation (Status: In Progress)**

**Goals:**  
Establish the core architecture, validate assumptions, and prepare for a minimal but functional public launch.

**Key Deliverables:**

- Smart contract architecture design
- Market Factory + Market Pools prototype
- Oracle & validator framework blueprint
- Initial frontend scaffolding
- Somnia integration (wallet + RPC + testnet deployment)
- Brand identity, documentation, and whitepaper foundation
- Basic backend indexer prototype
- Internal testing with synthetic markets

**Outcomes:**

- Functional internal demo
- Validated UX flow
- Solid technical foundation to begin public pilot


## **Phase 1 — MVP Launch on Somnia (Public Beta)**

**Goals:**  
Release a simple, clean prediction market experience focused on ease of use and real-world adoption.

**Core Features:**

- Binary YES/NO markets
- Market creation with approved settlement sources
- Oracle aggregation service (single-source with backups)
- Basic validator participation (semi-manual in early stage)
- Staking & claiming UI
- Protocol + Creator + Validator fee model
- Market discovery interface
- Basic profile pages (creator & participant stats)

**Ecosystem Actions:**

- Somnia public testnet launch
- Incentivized testnet campaigns
- Partnerships with communities for themed markets
- Feedback-driven iteration cycles

**Outcomes:**

- First real user activity
- Stable core infrastructure
- Foundation for decentralization and advanced features


## **Phase 2 — Expansion & Decentralization (GPRED Optional Intro Phase)**

**Goals:**  
Expand market capabilities, introduce deeper incentives, and begin shifting power toward the community.

**Key Features:**

- Multi-outcome markets
- Time-based markets
- Advanced Oracle layer with multi-source aggregation
- Automated validator consensus workflow
- Reputation system for creators & validators
- Market categories & improved search/discovery
- Seasonal market events
- Deeper analytics and user insights

**Optional GPRED Launch (if conditions met):**

- Governance voting
- Validator staking + slashing
- Creator boosts & incentives
- Seasonal GPRED reward pools

**Ecosystem Actions:**

- gPredict community council formation
- Creator and validator onboarding programs
- Third-party integrations (partners, games, DAOs)

**Outcomes:**

- Semi-decentralized governance
- Mature market ecosystem
- Expanded user base


## **Phase 3 — Multi-Chain Expansion**

**Goals:**  
Scale gPredict beyond Somnia and unify prediction experiences across ecosystems.

**Key Features:**

- Multi-chain adapter layer
- Deployment on 1–2 EVM chains (TBD)
- Cross-chain market synchronization
- Optional cross-chain liquidity
- Universal creator identity
- Interoperable oracle layer

**Ecosystem Actions:**

- Cross-chain partnerships
- Launchpad campaigns
- Co-branded community competitions

**Outcomes:**

- gPredict becomes a multi-chain prediction hub
- Broader exposure and liquidity
- Foundation for mass adoption


## **Phase 4 — Full Decentralization & Autonomous Ecosystem**

**Goals:**  
Transition gPredict into a fully decentralized, community-owned forecasting network.

**Key Features:**

- DAO-controlled protocol
- Treasury managed entirely by governance
- Validator committees & oracle councils
- Public proposal process (GIPs)
- Automated funding for creators, validators, and ecosystem builders
- Fully open-source infrastructure

**Ecosystem Actions:**

- Ongoing grant programs
- Global forecasting competitions
- Ecosystem-driven expansions

**Outcomes:**

- Fully decentralized prediction market protocol
- Community-led innovation
- Long-term sustainability without central oversight


# Summary

The roadmap ensures gPredict grows responsibly — from a simple, Somnia-first MVP into a decentralized, multi-chain prediction ecosystem governed by its community. Each phase builds sequentially, ensuring security, usability, and meaningful decentralization at every step.
