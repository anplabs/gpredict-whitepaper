# FAQ

## 1. **What is gPredict?**

**Answer:**  
gPredict is a decentralized prediction market protocol built by ANP Labs, launching first on the Somnia blockchain. It allows users to create, participate in, and settle prediction markets on real-world and digital events.


## 2. **How do prediction markets work on gPredict?**

**Answer:**  
Users stake SOMI tokens on an outcome (YES/NO or multiple choices). Once the event concludes, validators confirm the correct result, and rewards are distributed proportionally to those who predicted correctly.


## 3. **Which blockchain does gPredict use?**

**Answer:**  
gPredict launches on **Somnia**, leveraging its low fees, speed, and developer-friendly infrastructure. Future phases will expand to multiple EVM chains through the gPredict multi-chain adapter system.


## 4. **Do I need KYC to use gPredict?**

**Answer:**  
No. gPredict is a decentralized, non-custodial protocol. Users only need a compatible wallet to interact with the system. However, users are responsible for following their local regulations.


## 5. **What currency does gPredict use?**

**Answer:**  
gPredict uses **SOMI**, the native token of Somnia, for:

- Market participation
- Market creation
- Validator payments
- Fee distribution

A future governance/utility token, **GPRED**, may be introduced in Phase 2+.


## 6. **How do rewards work?**

**Answer:**  
If a user stakes on the winning outcome, they receive:

- Their original stake
- A proportional share of the total losing-side pool
- Minus protocol, validator, and creator fees

All calculations are performed on-chain for transparency.


## 7. **Who can create prediction markets?**

**Answer:**  
Anyone. Market creators choose:

- The question
- The outcomes
- The market end time
- The settlement data source

Creators earn a fee when their market settles.


## 8. **How are markets settled?**

**Answer:**  
gPredict uses a two-layer settlement process:

1. **Oracle Layer** fetches results from approved data sources
2. **Validator Layer** confirms the results and publishes the final outcome on-chain

This prevents manipulation and keeps settlement trustless.


## 9. **What prevents market manipulation?**

**Answer:**  
gPredict includes:

- Locked deadlines preventing last-second manipulation
- Multi-source oracle checks
- Validator consensus
- Dispute resolution (Phase 2+)
- Reputation systems for creators and validators


## 10. **What happens if the oracle data is wrong or disputed?**

**Answer:**  
The market enters **dispute mode**, where:

- Validators re-review the data
- Additional sources are checked
- A final consensus is reached

Disputes ensure fairness and accuracy.


## 11. **Are my funds safe?**

**Answer:**  
Yes. Funds are:

- Stored in audited smart contracts
- Fully non-custodial
- Released only based on validated settlement outcomes

The protocol never holds private keys or user funds directly.


## 12. **Is there a gPredict token?**

**Answer:**  
Not at MVP launch.  
The **GPRED token** may be introduced later for:

- Governance
- Staking
- Validator incentives
- Creator boosts
- Advanced features

The token will launch only when the ecosystem is mature enough.


## 13. **Is gPredict open-source?**

**Answer:**  
Yes. Core smart contracts, oracle logic, and validator tools will be progressively open-sourced as the protocol decentralizes.


## 14. **Can I build on top of gPredict?**

**Answer:**  
Yes. Developers will be able to:

- Create custom market interfaces
- Integrate prediction feeds into apps
- Use public APIs and indexer data
- Build tools for creators, validators, or communities


## 15. **Where can I follow updates or get support?**

**Answer:**  
You can join the official ANP Labs channels for:

- Product updates
- Development announcements
- Community events
- Support and documentation

Links will be available on the main website and GitHub repository.
