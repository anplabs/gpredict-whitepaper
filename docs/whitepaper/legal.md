> Ensuring Transparency, Neutrality, and Regulatory Alignment for gPredict

gPredict is a **decentralized prediction protocol** developed by **ANP Labs**, an international technology company incorporated in the **British Virgin Islands (BVI)**.  
As a Somnia‑first blockchain application, gPredict enables users to participate in **information markets**, not gambling or wagering.

gPredict is **not a betting platform**, **not a casino**, and **not a gambling service**.  
All market outcomes are based on **community sentiment, public information, and transparent data sources**, aligned with the global legal classification of **prediction markets as informational tools**, not games of chance.

ANP Labs is committed to:

- Legal transparency
- User protection
- Responsible participation
- Regulatory alignment
- Data privacy (LGPD + GDPR)
- Clear risk disclosure

This section outlines the legal framework governing the protocol.

## 1. Nature of the Platform (Not Gambling / Not Betting)

gPredict is classified as a **decentralized information and forecasting protocol**, not a betting platform.

Key distinctions:

### ✔ No “house”, no odds manipulation

There is **no operator acting as a counterparty**.  
All pools are entirely user-driven.

### ✔ Outcomes are based on verifiable data

Market settlement depends on:

- Public information
- Oracle aggregation
- Validator consensus

### ✔ No games of chance

Outcomes are based on **real‑world events**, not random number generation or luck-based mechanics.

### ✔ No guaranteed payouts

Rewards depend solely on the relative distribution of stakes within the market pools.

### ✔ User-generated questions

All markets are created transparently by the community, with predefined rules and criteria.

### ✔ No custody of user funds

Users interact directly with smart contracts.  
ANP Labs never touches, controls, or intermediates funds.

These characteristics legally differentiate prediction markets from gambling operations in most jurisdictions.

## 2. User Eligibility & Local Laws

gPredict is a global, decentralized protocol.  
However, **users are fully responsible for determining whether they can legally participate based on their local regulations**.

### User eligibility conditions:

- Must be legally considered an adult in their jurisdiction
- Must not be prohibited from using blockchain-based informational markets
- Must have legal permission to interact with decentralized finance tools
- Must accept personal responsibility for risks involved

ANP Labs **cannot verify user nationality, age, or eligibility** because the protocol is decentralized and non‑custodial.

If a user’s local laws restrict participation in forecasting protocols or crypto platforms, **they must not use gPredict**.

## ANP Labs Legal Framework (BVI Jurisdiction)

ANP Labs will also be formally registered in the **British Virgin Islands (BVI)** to support international operations.

The BVI jurisdiction is widely used for:

- Technology and software development companies
- Decentralized protocol operators
- Non-custodial crypto applications
- Global digital asset businesses

Key regulatory considerations in BVI:

- The **BVI Virtual Assets Service Providers Act (VASP Act)** governs entities directly providing custodial or exchange services
- gPredict does **not** operate as a VASP because:
  - It is non-custodial
  - It does not hold, manage, or transfer user assets
  - It does not provide exchange, wallet, or brokerage functions
  - It is a decentralized forecasting protocol

Thus, gPredict falls under BVI’s category of **non-VASP technology service providers**, which are permitted to operate without requiring a VASP license.

BVI law recognizes:

- Smart contract protocols as software tools
- Non-custodial applications as outside financial service activities
- Decentralized platforms as autonomous digital systems

This ensures regulatory clarity for international operations.

All corporate matters involving the BVI entity follow **BVI jurisdiction**.

All disputes involving ANP Labs as a company (not the decentralized protocol itself) fall under **BVI jurisdiction**.  
Protocol-level interactions, being decentralized, are not governed by any specific jurisdiction.

## 4. Protocol Autonomy & Decentralization

gPredict is a **software protocol**, not a service provider.  
Core properties:

### ✔ Non-custodial

Smart contracts retain funds — not ANP Labs.

### ✔ Open-source

Users can review, audit, or fork the code.

### ✔ Permissionless

Anyone can create and participate in markets.

### ✔ Validator-driven settlement

ANP Labs does not determine outcomes.  
Settlement is community-verified.

### ✔ Immutable logic

Once deployed, smart contracts execute automatically.

This minimizes regulatory risk by eliminating operator discretion—an important differentiator from regulated betting activities.

## 5. No Financial Advice or Investment Guarantee

gPredict is **not an investment service**.  
The protocol:

- Provides no guaranteed returns
- Does not offer financial products
- Does not manage assets
- Does not recommend outcomes or markets

Users participate based on their own judgment and information.

---

## 6. Risk Disclosure

Users must understand the risks of blockchain-based participation:

### ✔ Market risk

Stake values may change based on pool dynamics.

### ✔ Oracle delays or disputes

Settlement may require additional validator steps if data sources conflict.

### ✔ Smart contract risk

Despite audits, bugs may exist.

### ✔ Regulatory changes

Laws can evolve and may affect user eligibility.

### ✔ Volatility of blockchain assets

Token values used in markets may fluctuate.

Participation should occur **only with funds users can afford to lose**.

---

## 7. Data Privacy

gPredict complies with:

- **EU GDPR**
- **California CCPA (where applicable)**

The protocol:

- Minimally collects personal information
- Never sells user data
- Does not require identity verification
- Uses wallet addresses only for protocol interaction

Users retain full control of their crypto wallets and data.

## 8. No Custodial Responsibility

Because gPredict is a decentralized protocol:

- ANP Labs does not hold user funds
- ANP Labs cannot reverse transactions
- ANP Labs cannot guarantee recovery of lost private keys
- All blockchain interactions are final

Users must adopt secure wallet practices.

## 9. Dispute Resolution

Most disputes are resolved at the **protocol level** through:

- Oracle aggregation
- Validator consensus
- Dispute-mode processes

For issues involving **documentation, branding, partnerships, or technical misunderstandings**, users may contact ANP Labs support, but ANP Labs **cannot modify smart contract outcomes**.

All external legal disputes involving ANP Labs (excluding decentralized protocol behavior) are governed by **BVI jurisdiction**.

## 10. Final Legal Disclaimer

By using gPredict, users agree that:

- The protocol is a decentralized forecasting tool, **not gambling**
- ANP Labs does not act as a bookmaker, casino, or counterparty
- Users are solely responsible for compliance with their local laws
- All participation is voluntary and at the user's own risk
- Smart contract interactions are final and irreversible
- gPredict provides no financial advice or guaranteed outcomes
- ANP Labs may update documentation to reflect regulatory changes

gPredict is built for **transparency, neutrality, and responsible participation**.
