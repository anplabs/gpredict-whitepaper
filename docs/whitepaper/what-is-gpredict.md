# What is gPredict?

gPredict is a next‑generation, community‑driven prediction market protocol built by ANP Labs and deployed first on the Somnia blockchain. It provides a simple, transparent, and scalable way for users to create, participate in, and settle predictions across real‑world and digital events.

At its core, gPredict enables anyone to ask a question about the future — and lets the community collectively determine the probability of each outcome by staking on it. The result is a decentralized forecasting engine that transforms community sentiment into measurable market signals.

## **A Simple, Accessible Prediction Layer**

Unlike traditional prediction markets that rely on complex AMMs, steep learning curves, or high‑fee environments, gPredict focuses on making forecasting intuitive:

- One‑click participation
- Clear YES/NO market structure
- Transparent pool‑based odds
- Seamless Somnia‑native UX

This lowers the barrier to entry and allows prediction markets to reach everyday users, not just experts or speculators.

## **Somnia‑Native, Multi‑Chain by Design**

gPredict launches on Somnia to take advantage of:

- low fees
- fast confirmations
- high throughput
- developer‑friendly ecosystem

However, its architecture includes modular chain adapters, enabling future deployment on multiple EVM networks. The long‑term vision is to unify prediction markets across chains under a shared identity and liquidity layer.

## **Creator‑Powered Markets**

Any user can become a Market Creator. Creators define:

- the event
- the available outcomes
- the market end time
- the settlement data source

In return, Creators earn a share of fees when their markets conclude. This structure promotes a vibrant ecosystem where communities build predictions around:

- crypto
- eSports
- global events
- entertainment
- Web3 culture
- game‑specific events (including future MetaHoof integrations)

## **Decentralized Settlement Through Validators**

gPredict uses a transparent Oracle and Validator layer to ensure fair market resolution. Validators confirm event outcomes using pre‑agreed data sources. This reduces the risk of manipulation, ensures trustless settlement, and strengthens the protocol’s neutrality.

Future versions include staking, slashing, and validator reputation systems.

## **Designed for Growth and Community Governance**

As gPredict expands, governance progressively shifts toward a community‑driven model. Users may vote on:

- fee structures
- market categories
- oracle providers
- protocol upgrades

The goal is to create a self‑sustaining forecasting ecosystem owned and shaped by its participants.


gPredict is more than a prediction market — it is the foundation of a decentralized intelligence network powered by the collective insights of its community. It transforms the act of forecasting from a niche activity into an accessible, incentivized, and socially driven experience across Somnia and the broader Web3 landscape.
