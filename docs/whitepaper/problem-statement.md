# Problem Statement

Prediction markets have existed for decades, yet their adoption has been limited by a series of structural, technical, and economic barriers. While they have demonstrated strong potential as tools for collective forecasting, most implementations remain inaccessible to the majority of users. gPredict was created in response to the following core problems:

## **1. Complexity and High Friction for New Users**

Most prediction platforms require:

- multiple wallet interactions
- confusing AMM-based odds
- high cognitive load for understanding market behavior
- fragmented UX flows

This complexity discourages onboarding and prevents mainstream adoption.

## **2. High Transaction Costs and Poor Scalability**

Existing markets deployed on high-fee networks make small predictions unfeasible.

- Gas fees often exceed the size of user stakes
- Settlement becomes expensive
- Market creation is economically prohibitive

These constraints block experimentation, micro-markets, and casual prediction culture.

## **3. Centralized or Opaque Settlement Logic**

A large portion of prediction platforms rely on:

- centralized operators
- non-transparent oracles
- opaque resolution criteria

This leads to mistrust, manipulation risk, and a lack of community governance.

## **4. Limited Community Ownership**

In many current systems:

- users cannot meaningfully influence platform decisions
- creators have limited control
- validators have no incentives
- communities cannot build prediction ecosystems around their interests

This reduces engagement and prevents the organic growth needed for sustainability.

## **5. Lack of Multi-Chain Support**

Most platforms are isolated to a single chain, bringing issues such as:

- limited liquidity
- small user bases
- lack of cross-ecosystem exposure
- inability to scale to new user segments

A unified multi-chain prediction layer does not exist today.

## **6. Poor Incentive Models**

Current markets often fail to reward:

- market creators
- validators
- active forecasters

Without balanced incentives, ecosystems stagnate.


These challenges form the basis of gPredict’s purpose:  
**to deliver a simple, transparent, Somnia-native prediction market that removes entry friction, aligns incentives, decentralizes settlement, and scales across chains.**
