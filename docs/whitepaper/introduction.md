# Introduction

gPredict is a next-generation, community-driven prediction market built by [ANP Labs](https://anplabs.io) and launched first on the Somnia blockchain. It is designed to make forecasting accessible, transparent, and engaging for everyone—from casual participants to power users seeking deeper insights and higher-stakes challenges.

Traditional prediction markets often suffer from complexity, high transaction costs, unclear settlement logic, or opaque governance. **gPredict** was created to solve these problems with a focus on simplicity, modularity, and fairness. By leveraging Somnia’s high-performance architecture, gPredict enables fast, low-cost participation and a smooth onboarding experience for new users entering the world of on-chain predictions.

Prediction markets have demonstrated immense potential as tools for aggregating collective intelligence. When communities can openly stake on outcomes, the result is a powerful mechanism for measuring sentiment, forecasting future events, and improving decision-making. gPredict brings this capability into an environment that is open, decentralized, and shaped by the very community that uses it.

This whitepaper outlines the foundation of gPredict—its vision, architecture, economic model, and long-term roadmap. It serves as both a technical resource and a philosophical guide for the evolution of a simple but scalable prediction platform that will extend across chains, empower market creators, and grow through community governance.

gPredict is more than a product. It is the beginning of a new forecasting ecosystem for the Somnia universe and beyond.
